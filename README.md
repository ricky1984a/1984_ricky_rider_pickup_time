# Uber Pickups Data Analysis

This repository demonstrates a simple data analysis workflow for an Uber pickups dataset using Python, **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**. The code performs data cleaning, manipulates timestamps, and visualizes hourly pickup trends as well as the relationship between time and number of rides.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**  
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **seaborn** (for statistical graphics)  
- **matplotlib** (for plotting)

Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

## Dataset
This example code uses a CSV file named **`uber_pickups.csv`** that contains columns such as:
- **`pickup_time`**: The date and time of the Uber pickup.  
- **`number_of_rides`**: The number of rides corresponding to a particular hour or time segment.  
- *(Any additional columns relevant to your dataset.)*

> **Note**: Make sure to update the CSV file path to match your local setup or file location.

## Usage
1. **Clone or Download** this repository.  
2. **Place** the `uber_pickups.csv` file in the same directory as the script (or update the file path accordingly).  
3. **Run** the Python script:

```bash
python uber_analysis.py


Visualization
Two primary charts will be generated:

Histogram of Pickups by Hour

Displays the frequency of Uber pickups throughout the 24-hour day.
Scatter Plot of Hour vs. Number of Rides

Helps in understanding any correlation between time of day and the volume of rides.
These plots can offer insights such as peak hours and how the number of rides changes over time.
